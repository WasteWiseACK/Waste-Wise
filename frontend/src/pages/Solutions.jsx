      <h3>Solution One</h3>
      <p>
        Composting is a useful method for handling food-waste because it produces nutrient-rich compost that can improve soil from food scraps, yard trash, and other biodegradable items.
        Establishing community composting programs in residences, workplaces, and educational institutions might motivate people to contribute to the reduction of food waste.
        In addition to reducing the amount of trash dumped in landfills, composting also reduces greenhouse gas emissions from food decay.
        Additionally, the compost that is produced can be applied to farms, gardens, and landscaping projects, which will support sustainable agricultural methods and create healthier plants.
