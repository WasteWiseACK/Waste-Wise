      <h2>There are several solutions we can do to support the battle against food-waste; Here are a few best solutions :</h2>

      <h3>Solution One</h3>
      <p>
        Composting is a useful method for handling food-waste because it produces nutrient-rich compost that can improve soil from food scraps, yard trash, and other biodegradable items.
        Establishing community composting programs in residences, workplaces, and educational institutions might motivate people to contribute to the reduction of food waste.
        In addition to reducing the amount of trash dumped in landfills, composting also reduces greenhouse gas emissions from food decay.
        Additionally, the compost that is produced can be applied to farms, gardens, and landscaping projects, which will support sustainable agricultural methods and create healthier plants.
      </p>

      <h3>Solution Two</h3>
      <p>
        Campaigns for consumer education and awareness are essential to modifying consumer behavior around food waste.
        These programs can take many different forms, such as seminars, social media campaigns, and educational materials that educate individuals on smart meal planning, safe food storage methods, and inventive ways to repurpose leftovers.
        Providing people and families with the necessary knowledge to make educated decisions, these kinds of programs can aid in lowering family food waste.
        Promoting habits like recycling food scraps, knowing expiration dates, and only purchasing what is necessary will cause a cultural change towards more sustainable consumption patterns, which will ultimately reduce food waste in communities.
      </p>

      <h3>Solution Three</h3>
      <p>
        Food recovery initiatives are essential in combating food waste because they save excess food from grocery shops, restaurants, farms, and other establishments before it ends up in a landfill.
        Food banks, shelters, community kitchens, and other nonprofits in the area that can provide the food collected to those in need are often partners in these programs, which connect food donors with food donors.
        Through this redistribution, food recovery projects help communities deal with hunger and food insecurity while simultaneously diverting a substantial amount of food from trash.
        Coordination, planning, and occasionally legal protections for food donors are necessary for the implementation of these initiatives, although the social and environmental advantages can be significant.
