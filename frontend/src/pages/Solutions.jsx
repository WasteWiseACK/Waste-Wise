      <h2>There are several solutions we can do to support the battle against food-waste; Here are a few best solutions :</h2>

      <h3>Solution One</h3>
      <p>
        Composting is a useful method for handling food-waste because it produces nutrient-rich compost that can improve soil from food scraps, yard trash, and other biodegradable items.
        Establishing community composting programs in residences, workplaces, and educational institutions might motivate people to contribute to the reduction of food waste.
        In addition to reducing the amount of trash dumped in landfills, composting also reduces greenhouse gas emissions from food decay.
        Additionally, the compost that is produced can be applied to farms, gardens, and landscaping projects, which will support sustainable agricultural methods and create healthier plants.

      <h3>Solution Two</h3>
      <p>
        Campaigns for consumer education and awareness are essential to modifying consumer behavior around food waste.
        These programs can take many different forms, such as seminars, social media campaigns, and educational materials that educate individuals on smart meal planning, safe food storage methods, and inventive ways to repurpose leftovers.
        Providing people and families with the necessary knowledge to make educated decisions, these kinds of programs can aid in lowering family food waste.
        Promoting habits like recycling food scraps, knowing expiration dates, and only purchasing what is necessary will cause a cultural change towards more sustainable consumption patterns, which will ultimately reduce food waste in communities.
